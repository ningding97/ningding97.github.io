#### Bio

I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor at the [Department of Electronic Engineering](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).
Previously, I was a postdoc researcher in the same department, advised by Prof. Bowen Zhou.
I received Ph.D. at the Department of Computer Science and Technology,  Tsinghua Univeristy in 2023, advised by Prof. Hai-Tao Zheng and also co-advised by Prof. Zhiyuan Liu.


#### Research
My research spans the areas of natural language processing and machine learning. 
Currently I am working on theories and *scalable* methods for developing reasoning intelligence that balances exploration and learning. I am also interested in how specialized general reasoners can facilitate scientific innovations.
