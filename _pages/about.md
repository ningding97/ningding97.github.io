### Bio

I received my Ph.D. at the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/csen/index.html/),  [Tsinghua Univeristy](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in 2023, advised by Prof. [Hai-Tao Zheng](https://dblp.org/pid/20/134.html) and also co-advised by Prof. [Zhiyuan Liu](http://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/).


### Research
My research spans the areas of natural language processing and machine learning. At the current stage, I am particularly interested advanced stimulation of language models. My research aims to develop theory, tools, and algorithms to effectively and efficiently drive language models (especially the large ones), and also establish a deeper understanding by observing the behaviors of models.
